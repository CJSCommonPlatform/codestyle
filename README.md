# CJS Common Platform Code Style Guide

## Java

These are based on the [Google Java Style](http://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
guidelines, with the following changes:

* Indents are 4 spaces instead of 2
* `uk.gov` imports are listed first instead of `com.google`
* `java` and `javax` imports are listed before 3rd party imports

It is not possible to entirely rely on IDE auto-formatting to enforce these rules. However, The following IDE settings can be
used to minimise the effort.

### Intellij

* Download the [Intellij CJS Common Platform Style](https://github.com/CJSCommonPlatform/styleguide/raw/master/intellij-java-cjs-style.xml) file.
* In Intellij, go to Settings > Code Style > Manage... and import the downloaded file.

### Eclipse

* Download the [Eclipse CJS Common Platform Style](https://github.com/CJSCommonPlatform/styleguide/raw/master/eclipse-java-cjs-style.xml) file.
